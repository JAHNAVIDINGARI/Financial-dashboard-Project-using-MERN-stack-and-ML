#   Finance Dashboard Project using MERN stack and  Machine Learning

This project is a full-stack MERN Finance Dashboard Application integrating real-time analytics, data visualization, and machine learning–based financial predictions.
The frontend is built using Vite, React, Redux Toolkit, Material UI, and Recharts to deliver a fast, responsive, and visually rich user experience. 
The backend leverages Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, providing secure API endpoints, structured data modeling, and seamless communication with the frontend. 
The application includes dashboards for KPIs, products, transactions, and revenue insights, along with a regression-based ML prediction module to forecast future financial trends.
It demonstrates full-stack development, state management, charting, and basic machine learning integration within a modern MERN architecture.
